    <p>Einstein's legacy in physics is significant. Here are some of his key scientific principles that he pioneered:
Theory of special relativity: Einstein showed that physical laws are identical for all observers, as long as they are not under acceleration. However, the speed of light in a vacuum is always the same, no matter at what speed the observer is travelling. This work led to his realization that space and time are linked into what we now call space-time. So, an event seen by one observer may be seen at a different time by another observer. 
Theory of general relativity: This was a reformulation of the law of gravity. In the 1600s, Newton formulated three laws of motion, among them outlining how gravity works between two bodies. The force between them depends on how massive each object is, and how far apart the objects are. Einstein determined that when thinking about space-time, a massive object is a distortion in space-time (like putting a heavy ball on a trampoline.) Gravity is exerted when other objects fall into the "well" created by the distortion in space-time, like a marble rolling towards the large ball.
Photoelectric effect: Einstein's work in 1905 proposed that light should be thought of as a stream of particles (photons) instead of just a single wave, as was commonly thought by the time. His work helped explain some curious results scientists saw at the time. The photoelectric effect refers to how electrons are ejected from the surface of a metal due to incident light. The "wave" theory of light suggests that the electrons should be ejected with more energy when the incident light is increased, but experiments showed that the energies are actually independent of the radiation intensity. 
        "It was a difficult idea to accept at the time," Cliff said. "It contradicted the 19th-century wave picture of light."
Unified field theory: Einstein spent much of his later years trying to merge the fields of electromagnetism and gravity. He was unsuccessful, but Encyclopedia Britannica suggests that Einstein was ahead of his time because, for example, the strong force in quantum mechanics was better understood in the 1970s and 1980s. Other physicists are still working on this problem.~ Space.com</p>

        And when the mutual annihilation was complete, one billionth remained - and that's our present universe." - Albert Einstein</p>
